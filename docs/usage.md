## 🎨 Creator — Start a Novel

### 1. Create a Novel

Upload your genesis content (prologue / world setting) to IPFS or Arweave, then call:

```solidity
NovelCore.createNovel{value: <prizePoolAmount>}(
    NovelConfig calldata config,
    bytes32[] calldata genesisContentHashes,
    uint64[] calldata genesisLengths
) → uint256 novelId
```

**Parameters:**
- `config` — Novel rules (see [NovelConfig Parameters](#appendix-novelconfig-parameters))
- `genesisContentHashes` — Array of CIDs for genesis chapters on IPFS/Arweave. Each genesis chapter becomes an initial world line. Must have at least 1 and at most `worldLineCount` entries.
- `genesisLengths` — Array of byte lengths for each genesis chapter (must match `genesisContentHashes` length)
- `msg.value` — ETH to seed the initial prize pool (optional, can be 0)

**Example (cast):**
```bash
# Note: takes arrays for genesis content hashes and lengths
cast send $NOVEL_CORE "createNovel((uint64,uint64,uint64,uint32,uint32,uint32,uint16,uint16,uint64,uint64,uint256,uint8,uint8,string),bytes32[],uint64[])" \
  "(100,10000,86400,3,2,3,3000,1000,259200,172800,10000000000000000,3,20,https://arweave.net/)" \
  "[0x<genesis_cid_1>]" \
  "[200]" \
  --value 1ether \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### 2. Fork a Novel

Create a new novel branching from a rejected chapter of an existing novel:

```solidity
NovelCore.forkNovel{value: <prizePoolAmount>}(
    uint256 originalNovelId,
    uint256 branchChapterId,
    NovelConfig calldata config
) → uint256 novelId
```

> **Note:** You can only fork from chapters that are NOT currently Canon. Forking requires paying at least the original novel's `stakeAmount` as a fork fee (injected into the original novel's prize pool). The creator royalty in forked novels flows to the **original creator**, not the fork caller. Content base URL is inherited from the original novel.

---

## ✍️ Author — Write & Submit Chapters

### 1. Check Active World Lines

Before writing, check which world lines (story branches) are currently active:

```solidity
NovelCore.getActiveWorldLines(uint256 novelId) → uint256[] chapterIds
```

Read each world line's content via its `contentHash`:

```solidity
NovelCore.getChapter(uint256 chapterId) → Chapter
// → chapter.contentHash is the IPFS/Arweave CID to read
```

### 2. Submit a Chapter

Write your continuation, upload to IPFS/Arweave, then submit:

```solidity
NovelCore.submitChapter{value: <stakeAmount>}(
    uint256 novelId,
    uint256 parentChapterId,    // Must be an active world line
    bytes32 contentHash,        // Your content's IPFS/Arweave CID
    uint64 declaredLength       // Content byte length
) → uint256 chapterId
```

**Requirements:**
- Novel must be in `Submitting` phase
- `parentChapterId` must be an active world line
- `declaredLength` must be within `[minChapterLength, maxChapterLength]`
- `msg.value` must exactly equal the configured `stakeAmount`

### 3. Claim Stake Refund

After a round settles, if you were not penalized, your stake is refundable:

```solidity
NovelCore.claimStakeRefund(uint256 novelId)
```

> **When you get slashed (50%):** Only if you've been in the bottom percentile for M consecutive rounds (pollution). Pollution is only checked when there are at least 10 submissions in the round.

### 4. Claim Author Rewards

If your chapter made it into Canon during an Epoch settlement:

```solidity
PrizePool.claimReward(uint256 novelId)
```

Check your pending reward first:

```solidity
PrizePool.getPendingReward(uint256 novelId, address author) → uint256
```

> **Note:** The novel creator also claims from `PrizePool.claimReward()` — the creator royalty is credited to `_pendingRewards` alongside author rewards.

---

## 🗳️ Voter — Vote on Story Directions

Voting uses a **Commit-Reveal** scheme to prevent front-running and vote copying.

### 1. Commit Phase — Submit Encrypted Vote

First, compute your vote commitment off-chain:

```javascript
// Off-chain (ethers.js)
const candidateId = 42;  // The chapter ID you want to vote for
const salt = ethers.utils.randomBytes(32);
const commitHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
    ["uint256", "bytes32"],
    [candidateId, salt]
);
// IMPORTANT: Save your candidateId and salt — you need them to reveal!
```

Then submit on-chain:

```solidity
VotingEngine.commitVote{value: <optionalStake>}(
    uint256 novelId,
    uint256 votingRoundId,
    bytes32 commitHash
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `votingRoundId` — See [Voting Round ID Computation](#appendix-voting-round-id-computation)
- `commitHash` — `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(candidateId, salt))`
- `msg.value` — Stake-to-Vote: more ETH = more voting weight

### 2. Reveal Phase — Show Your Vote

After the commit phase closes:

```solidity
VotingEngine.revealVote(
    uint256 novelId,
    uint256 votingRoundId,
    uint256 candidateId,    // The chapter you voted for
    bytes32 salt            // The salt you used in commit
)
```

> ⚠️ **If you don't reveal in time, your vote is lost.** Your staked ETH is also forfeited.

### 3. Claim Voting Stake Refund

After the round is tallied, ALL revealed voters (majority and minority) can claim. The claim includes up to three parts:

- **Stake refund** — All revealed voters get their staked ETH back
- **Unrevealed stake share** — If `sweepUnrevealedStakes` has been called, confiscated stakes are distributed proportionally to revealed voters
- **Accuracy reward** — If `voterRewardPool > 0` (from epoch distribution), accurate voters (who voted for the winning candidate) receive rewards with 3x weight

```solidity
VotingEngine.claimVotingReward(uint256 novelId, uint256 votingRoundId)
```

### Sweep Unrevealed Stakes

After tally, anyone can call this to confiscate unrevealed voters' stakes and redistribute them to revealed voters:

```solidity
// Anyone can call after tally — confiscates unrevealed stakes, redistributes to revealed voters
VotingEngine.sweepUnrevealedStakes(uint256 novelId, uint256 votingRoundId)
```

### Checking Candidates

See what you can vote for:

```solidity
VotingEngine.getCandidates(uint256 novelId, uint256 votingRoundId) → uint256[] candidateIds
```

## 📖 Reader — Tip & Support Novels

### Tip a Novel

Send ETH to expand a novel's prize pool:

```solidity
PrizePool.tipNovel{value: <amount>}(uint256 novelId)
```

**Requirements:**
- Minimum tip: `0.001 ETH`

**Example (cast):**
```bash
cast send $PRIZE_POOL "tipNovel(uint256)" 1 --value 0.5ether --private-key $KEY
```

### Check Pool Status

```solidity
PrizePool.getPoolBalance(uint256 novelId) → uint256       // Current distributable balance
PrizePool.getTotalTipped(uint256 novelId) → uint256        // Cumulative tips received
```

---

## ⚙️ Keeper — Trigger State Transitions

State transitions are permissionless — anyone can call them once conditions are met. This role is ideal for **AI Agents** that can monitor on-chain state and automatically trigger transitions at the right time.

Callers receive a small keeper reward from the prize pool (configurable by owner via `setKeeperRewardAmount`). If the pool is insufficient, the transition still executes but no reward is paid.

### Round Transitions

```solidity
// 1. Close submissions → start voting
//    Requires: roundMinDuration elapsed AND roundMinSubmissions met
NovelCore.closeSubmissions(uint256 novelId)

// 2. Close commit phase → start reveal phase
//    Requires: commitDuration elapsed
NovelCore.closeCommit(uint256 novelId)

// 3. Settle the round → tally votes, select world lines
//    Requires: revealDuration elapsed
NovelCore.settleRound(uint256 novelId)
```

### Epoch Transitions

```solidity
// 4. Close epoch commit → start epoch reveal
//    Requires: commitDuration elapsed
NovelCore.closeEpochCommit(uint256 novelId)

// 5. Settle the epoch → establish canon, mint NFTs, distribute rewards
//    Requires: revealDuration elapsed
NovelCore.settleEpoch(uint256 novelId)
```

### State Machine Flow

```
   ROUND                                    EPOCH
   ─────                                    ─────
   Submitting ──closeSubmissions──▸ Committing
   Committing ──closeCommit──────▸ Revealing
   Revealing  ──settleRound──────▸ { Next Round OR Epoch Committing }
                                        │
                                   Epoch Committing ──closeEpochCommit──▸ Epoch Revealing
                                   Epoch Revealing  ──settleEpoch──────▸ Next Epoch (Round 1)
```

## 🔍 Explorer — Query On-Chain State

All query functions are `view` (free, no gas required).

### Novel Queries

```solidity
NovelCore.getNovelCount() → uint256                               // Total novels created
NovelCore.getNovel(uint256 novelId) → Novel                       // Full novel state
NovelCore.getActiveWorldLines(uint256 novelId) → uint256[]        // Current world line chapter IDs
NovelCore.getRoundSubmissions(uint256 novelId, uint32 round) → uint256[]  // Submissions in a round
```

### Chapter Queries

```solidity
NovelCore.getChapterCount() → uint256                             // Total chapters (global)
NovelCore.getChapter(uint256 chapterId) → Chapter                 // Chapter details
```

**Chapter struct fields:**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Chapter ID |
| `novelId` | Which novel it belongs to |
| `parentId` | Parent chapter (0 = genesis root) |
| `author` | Author address |
| `contentHash` | IPFS/Arweave CID |
| `declaredLength` | Declared byte length |
| `round` / `epoch` | When it was submitted |
| `isWorldLine` | Selected as a world line in a round |
| `isCanon` | Selected as canon in an epoch |

### Voting Queries

```solidity
VotingEngine.getCandidates(novelId, votingRoundId) → uint256[]        // Candidate IDs
VotingEngine.getVoteCount(novelId, votingRoundId, candidateId) → uint256  // Votes for a candidate
VotingEngine.getVoteCommit(novelId, votingRoundId, voter) → VoteCommit    // A voter's commit state
```

### Prize Pool Queries

```solidity
PrizePool.getPoolBalance(uint256 novelId) → uint256               // Distributable balance
PrizePool.getPendingReward(uint256 novelId, address) → uint256    // Unclaimed author reward
PrizePool.getTotalTipped(uint256 novelId) → uint256               // Cumulative tips
```

### NFT Queries

```solidity
ChapterNFT.isChapterMinted(uint256 novelId, uint256 chapterId) → bool
ChapterNFT.getChapterInfo(uint256 tokenId) → ChapterNFTMetadata
```

## Appendix: Voting Round ID Computation

The `votingRoundId` is deterministically derived. Compute it off-chain:

```javascript
// For ROUND voting:
const votingRoundId = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
    ["uint256", "uint32", "uint32", "bool"],
    [novelId, epochNumber, roundNumber, false]  // false = round vote
);

// For EPOCH voting:
const votingRoundId = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
    ["uint256", "uint32", "uint32", "bool"],
    [novelId, epochNumber, roundNumber, true]   // true = epoch vote
);
```

You can also find the current `epochNumber` and `roundNumber` from `NovelCore.getNovel(novelId)`.
